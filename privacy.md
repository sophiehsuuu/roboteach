## Information We Collect

- **No Personal Data:** The Extension does **not** seek, collect, or store personally identifiable information (PII) about users.
- **Coding Data:** When you ask for help or debugging, the code or natural-language queries you enter may be sent securely to an AI backend server to generate responses. This data is used strictly for generating real-time advice and is **not stored long-term**.
- **Extension Preferences:** User preferences, such as language or UI settings, may be saved locally in your browser; this is never shared or transmitted externally.

## How We Use Information

- We **never** share or sell your data, and it is not used for advertising, marketing, or analytics.

## Data Security

- All communications with our backend (for AI code advice) are encrypted using industry-standard HTTPS.
- Only essential troubleshooting data (not personal identifiers) is included in these communications.

## Cookies and Local Storage

- The Extension only uses local browser storage to remember non-sensitive settings (such as language choice).
- **No cookies**, tracking scripts, or other user-tracking technologies are used.

## Third-party Services

- The Extension uses trusted, industry-compliant third-party AI services (such as OpenAI or Supabase) for generating advice. These services do not retain your data after processing your request.

## Your Rights and Choices
